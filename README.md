# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple and responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be played on both desktop and mobile devices. It allows two players to play, with the "O" player controlled by a simple bot that automatically makes its move after the "X" player.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for mobile devices.
- **Two Players**: Play against another human player or let the bot play as "O".
- **AI Bot**: The bot plays as the "O" player and chooses random empty cells to make its move.
- **Game Status**: Displays the current player's turn, and announces the winner or draw when the game ends.
- **Game Reset**: Click the reset button to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the game.
- **CSS**: Styled the game board and added responsiveness and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the game logic, player switching, winner detection, and bot moves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). There is no server setup required as this is a front-end only application.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chamidu788/xox-game-html-css-js.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd xox-game-html-css-js
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**

   Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to start playing.

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   Alternatively, you can just double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.

## Usage

- The game starts with Player X’s turn.
- Click on any empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
- After Player X makes a move, the bot (O) will automatically make its move.
- The game will announce the winner or a draw once the game ends.
- You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol ("X" or "O") on an empty cell.
3. The player who places three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

- Inspired by classic Tic-Tac-Toe games.
